At this moment, the company used dotnet MVC stack for a fullstack development of the solutions. Self-taught, i began to understand the nuances and patterns that development teams used to deliver new features. I studied for a year CSharp, MVC, OOP and the tools that surrounded the development ecosystems, market ORMs like Entity Framework and NHibernate. Even as a Support Analyst I started to contribute to the development and bug fixing, submitting my code to the analysis of several more experienced developers, which made me advance many spots on the path to be a good dev.",

The product to be developed for the customer started from scratch, using the CI & CD delivery standards, running a unit and integration test treadmill (using MsTest and xUnit) delivering the system in a webapplication on Azure, integrating with a SQL Server database. The product consists of solving problems of payment of transport vouchers and mobility of the workers of the company that would buy the solution. The big challenge of this project was integrate with the they routing tool (SATRotas - Roteirização) that they already developed.

A massive system using the SAAS (Software As A Service) standard and using cloud hosting on AWS as well as the use of all tools (S3, EC2 etc). Very interesting the way the frontend was built, using ngRx or Redux for Angular for state management. On the backend we used dotnetcore ver 2.3. My contribution time on this project was 1 year, undoubtedly a great learning experience for me from the perspective of multitenancy applications and new development patterns.",

It was a total immersion in the new standards of development, in a short time I was used to Typescript and now I use this language in most of my projects.
